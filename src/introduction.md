The Riscvonomicon (pronounced "risk five o-nomicon") provides a reference for
using the [RISC-V] instruction set and the [Rust] programming language
together. It contains information about:

* Utilizing Rust and RISC-V specific crates, tools and environments
* Building, testing, fuzzing and formally verify code for RISC-V written in Rust
* Utilizing RISC-V instructions, intrinsics and extensions in Rust

This book assumes familiarity with both the RISC-V instruction set and the
[Rust] programming language, and is made to extend the [Embedonomicon],
[Embedded Rust Book] and [Rustonomicon]. Some chapters within this book provide
information which generally useful for RISC-V or Rust.

This project is *not* an official Rust project, nor is it an official RISC-V
project.
